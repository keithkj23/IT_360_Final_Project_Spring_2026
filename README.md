## Project Ideas
* Hash Verification and Evidence Integrity Tool: would calculate and verify hashes such as (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) for files and or directories to verify their integrity
* Evidence File Organizer: Would automatically organize digital evidence by file type, date, and Hash value
* Automated Metadata Tool: Would be a python tool that scans files like documents, images, or videos and extracts forensic artifacts such as timestamps. usernames, GPS coordinates, and file creating or modification history from those files
